# Pizza's R Us

A Windows desktop application I created using C# and Visual Studio's WinForms framework. The application was created for my Programming unit in a level 3 Computing course I took. The application was developed for a hypothetical Pizza business that needed a Desktop application built for their tills in order to quickly calculate customer orders.

## Installation
Visual Studio installation is required to open up the project on a desktop device. Once installed, Pizzas R Us 2.sln can be opened within Visual Studio to view the project.
